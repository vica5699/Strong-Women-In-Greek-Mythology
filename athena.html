<head>Athena, Goddess of Wisdom and War </head>
<p>In most stories, Athena is portrayed as a majestic woman, with a beautiful, but serious face, full lips, grey eyes, and a build that shows power and authority. She is typically in full armor.</p>
       <br> <br>
        <p>She was a female version of Ares as a war goddess, as well as the female equivalent of Hephaestus in arts and crafts.</p>

        <br><br>
        <p>Arachne in Greek mythology was a weaver who challenged Athena and was consequently transformed into a spider. <br>There are three versions of the myth.
            <br><br>
            One version has it that she was a shepherd’s daughter that was particularly skilled at weaving. <br>Boasting about her skill, she infuriated Athena, who appeared and contested her. <br>Athena weaved four scenes in which the gods punished those humans that considered themselves equal to gods and committed hubris; Arachne, on the other hand, weaved scenes in which gods abused humans. <br>Arachne’s work was clearly better than Athena’s; the goddess even more enraged due to what the weaving depicted, threw Hecate’s potion onto Arachne, transforming her into a spider and condemning her to weave for eternity.</p>
            <br><br>
          <p>In a different version, at the challenge, Athena weaved the contest between herself and Poseidon over who the patron saint of Athens would be, while Arachne did a depiction of Zeus’ advances to various mortal women. <br>Athena realised how skilled Arachne was, but wanted to teach her to be more humble and respect the gods. <br>Touching Arachne’s forehead, the woman was filled with shame and hung herself. <br>Athena brought her back to life and turned her into a spider, in order to let her weave all the time.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>In the final version of the myth, Zeus was the judge in the contest between Arachne and Athena, and whoever lost would not be allowed to touch a spindle or the loom again. <br>Athena won in this version, and Arachne was devastated that she could no longer weave. <br>Out of pity, Athena transformed her into a spider, so she could continue weaving without having to break her oath.</p>
