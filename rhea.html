<br><br>
<p>Rhea was one of the Titans, daughter of Uranus and Gaea. <br>She was the sister and wife of Cronus, also a Titan. <br>She was responsible for the way things flow in the kingdom of Cronus (her name means 'that which flows').
    <br><br>
    Rhea and Cronus had six children; Hestia, Hades, Demeter, Poseidon, Hera and Zeus. <br>Cronus, afraid that he would be overthrown by his children just like he had done with his father, decided to swallow all of them. <br>However, he was tricked by Rhea, who managed to save Zeus from his father. <br>When Zeus grew up, he forced his father to disgorge his siblings and eventually overthrew him.
    <br><br>
    Although Rhea was considered the "mother of gods", similarly to Gaea and Cybele, she did not have a strong cult and many followers. <br>She had a temple in Crete, the place in which she hid Zeus to save from his father. <br>In art, she started appearing in the fourth century BC; however, she was often depicted with characteristics similar to those used for Cybele, thus making the two goddesses indistinguishable. <br>Rhea was often symbolised as a pair of lions that pulled a celestial chariot. <br>This symbol was often placed on city gates, the best known example being that at the city of Mycenae, where two stone lions guarded the gates.</p>
