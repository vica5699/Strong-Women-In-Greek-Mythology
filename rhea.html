</div>
<br><br>
<p>Rhea was responsible for helping things flow within her kingdom. <br>She was also given the title "mother of gods"</p>
<br>
<div>
    <p>Rhea may not be a very familiar female character in Greek mythology, likely because she is a Titan rather than a goddess.<br>However, this does not mean that she is not an important figure.<br>She was given the titles that were previously mentioned for a reason.<br>She assisted Zeus when he needed help and was certainly very important to everyone to be given the "mother of gods" title.</p>
